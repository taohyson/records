# psychology of the stock market

PREFACE

This book is based upon the belief that the movements of prices on the exchanges are dependent to a very large **degree** on the **mental attitude** of the **investing and trading public**.

It is the result of years of study and experience as **fellow** at Columbia University, news writer,statisticion, on the editorial staff of THE MAGAZINE OF WALL STREET, etc. 

The book is intended **chiefly** as a **practical** help to that considerable part of the community which is interested, directly or indirectly, in the markets; but it is hoped that it may also have some scientific value as a **preliminary** discussion in a new field, where **opportunities** for further research seem almost **unlimited**.

本书基于一个信条，即：价格波动，很大程度取决于参与投资与交易的群体心理。

本书定位，主要是给对市场感兴趣的大部分人带去实操性质类的帮助；当然也希望能在这个新兴前沿领域产生一些初步探讨的科学价值，这个新兴领域还有无穷的研究工作可做。
